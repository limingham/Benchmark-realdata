# Evaluating Deconvolution Methods Using Real Bulk RNA-expression Data for Robust Prognostic Insights in Pan-Cancer
Here, we introduce a novel real-data framework, leveraging 18 real bulk RNA-expression cohorts (5,891 samples) across nine cancer types to evaluate five deconvolution methods based on relative changes in differentially proportioned (DP) cell types—a robust and reliable metric. Across three innovative benchmark scenarios—consistency with scRNA-seq, reproducibility across cohorts, and reproducibility of prognostic relevance—ReCIDE and BayesPrism have been demonstrated to be the two most robust deconvolution methods. The specific design of the three evaluation scenarios is as follows:

### Publicly accessible code and results
All deconvolution results and benchmark codes have now been released!  All deconvolution results are located in the 'benchmark_deconvolution_results' folder, and the code and evaluation results corresponding to each benchmark scenario can be found in the respective figure folder (fig3, fig4, and fig5).

### Data Used in the Study
Our research utilized extensive single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-expression data, with their download links provided in the Public_data folder.
