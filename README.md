# Evaluating Deconvolution Methods Using Real Bulk RNA-expression Data for Robust Prognostic Insights in Pan-Cancer
Here, we introduce a novel real-data framework, leveraging 18 real bulk RNA-expression cohorts (5,891 samples) across nine cancer types to evaluate five deconvolution methods based on relative changes in differentially proportioned (DP) cell types—a robust and reliable metric. Across three innovative benchmark scenarios—consistency with scRNA-seq, reproducibility across cohorts, and reproducibility of prognostic relevance—ReCIDE and BayesPrism have been demonstrated to be the two most robust deconvolution methods. The specific design of the three evaluation scenarios is as follows:

All deconvolution results and benchmark codes have now been released! The evaluation results of the three assessment scenarios we designed correspond to the data and codes in the folders fig3, fig4, and fig5 respectively. You are welcome to check them out.
